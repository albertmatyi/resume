                  <p>I have managed to integrate into the ongoing <strong>web-based sales platform</strong>
                    project with ease. I saw this job as a great opportunity to learn about
                    the above mentioned technologies, and how such a large scale <strong>SCRUMM</strong> project that is about to have a public API for other clients is structured and developed.
                  </p>
                  <p>Although I have worked on many tasks regarding @EJB services <strong>JMS</strong>, my field of expertise was more related to the webapp part, where I have built deep understanding of how <strong>CDI</strong> and <strong>JSF</strong> / <strong>primefaces</strong> works.</p>
                  <p>Besides the day-to-day business related user-stories we were working
                    on, I was more than happy to create project wide solutions for problems
                    all of us faced or that would enhance the quality of the project, which
                    were appreciated by colleagues, just as some of my larger refactoring /
                    restructuring proposals in the webapp which we as a team implemented.
                  </p>
                  <p>Since we had a "no-tester" policy, everything was heavily tested
                    using integration and selenium test. Code quality and coverage was a
                    must which I easily met by following the TDD red-green-refactor
                    principle.
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the project was on going I free willingly left in seek of a less corporateish workplace.</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p>Working on a 5 people
                    project I was responsible for designing and implementing the back-end of
                    a CRM application for touch devices using spring, neo4j and flex.
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the service implementation - where we successfully used
                    custom AOP approaches - we had to find interesting approaches for
                    storage design, that is because we worked with a graph based DB (neo4j),
                    and the app should have taken advantage of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>Although the frontend consisted of Flex, I got to work on develop
                    with jsp, jquery and css as well for the admin part of the application.
                  </p>
                  <p>Along the application development I set up a continuous integration
                    environment (nexus, jenkins, sonar) for the team to provide us fast
                    feedback on stability and quality, which I have found very helpful.
                  </p>
                  <p>Starting from May 2012, I have completed a Flex self-training course,
                    and started working on the frontend of the application, dipping my toes
                    in the challenges of UI design and development. This experience taught
                    me a lot about interactive UI programming, most of which knowledge is
                    applicable both in the rich world of html &amp; js.
                  </p>
                  <p>My most notable contributions on the frontend side were defining
                    structural patterns that we should use and reimplementing a custom
                    gesture detection mechanism, because the one provided by the framework
                    did not fit our needs.

                  </ul>
                  <p>That meant developing Proof of concept applications on these platforms using mainly Java and C# .NET technologies.</p>
                  <p>My biggest contribution was a contest platform application developed
                    on top of Google App Engine using Java and Vaadin as the UI kit. It
                    featured an multilanguage CMS with authentication for contestants, who
                    could upload contest entries that were then ranked by the
                    administrators.
                  </p>
                  <p>For this webapp I created a desktop counterpart, using which anyone could:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>easily deploy any number of apps in the cloud</li>
                    <li>thoroughly UI test it (using Selenium Webdriver)</li>
